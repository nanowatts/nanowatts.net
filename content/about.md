Hey! I'm Justin. I'm an engineer and product person living in North Bend, WA.

I'm currently working with the good people of [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en) as a Technical Producer. In this role, I work on the roadmap, strategy, and vision for infrastructure and services behind [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/).

In the years before games, I spent the majority of my career building and delivering healthcare software. Healthcare in the United States is fundamentally broken and I am grateful to have spent a huge chunk of my career chipping away at hard problems in this space. I've had the pleasure to work with super innovative teams at [Sharecare](https://www.sharecare.com), [Elation Health](https://www.elationhealth.com), and [98point6](http://98point6.com).

I spend my personal time playing games, skiing, and making cocktails.

A large share of my games hobby is occupied by pursuits in Destiny 2, where I stay current to support Team Brenda in our quest for a World First title. Before coaching Team Brenda, I was on the PRIMEGUARD team that achieved the [World's First](https://kotaku.com/meet-the-people-who-beat-destinys-first-massive-raid-1635907715) clear of Vault of Glass: Destiny's first raid. After PRIMEGUARD, I co-founded another Destiny clan, [Math Class](https://twitter.com/mathclassgg), alongside a few of my best friends. 

In addition to Destiny, I love playing VALORANT. I don't have a deep history with tactical shooters. However, my lizard brain craves a hyper-competitive shooter environment, previously occupied by a local Halo LAN scene. VALORANT has begun to fill that void. I enjoy climbing ranks in the competitive playlist and constantly working to improve.

During winter, I try to be in the mountains as much as I can. I was first introduced to skiing in 2018 by my wife and now count it as my favorite hobby. Like games, I thrive on improvement and growth. I was able to start doing black rated runs and off-piste trails this past winter (2021) and am looking forward to being competent enough to make my way into the backcountry.
