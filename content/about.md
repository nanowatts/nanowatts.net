Hey! I'm Justin. I'm an engineer and product person living in North Bend, WA.

I'm currently working with the good people of [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en) as a Technical Product Manager. I primarily work on the roadmap, strategy, and vision for the tech behind [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) & [Teamfight Tactics](https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/).

In the years before games, I spent a majority of my career building and delivering healthcare software. Healthcare in the United States is fundamentally broken and I am grateful to have spent a huge chunk of my life chipping away at hard problems in this space. I've had the pleasure to work with super innovative teams at [Sharecare](https://www.sharecare.com), [Elation Health](https://www.elationhealth.com), and [98point6](http://98point6.com).

I spend my personal time playing games, skiing, and taking photos.

I was on the PRIMEGUARD team that achieved the [World's First](https://kotaku.com/meet-the-people-who-beat-destinys-first-massive-raid-1635907715) clear of Vault of Glass: Destiny's first raid. After PRIMEGUARD, I co-founded another Destiny clan, [Math Class](https://twitter.com/mathclassgg), alongside a few of my best friends.

During winter, I try to be in the mountains as much as I can. I was first introduced to skiing in 2018 by my wife, Chrissy, and now count it as my favorite thing to do. 

I also greatly enjoy photography. I picked it up during 2020 and have continued to grow my skills since. I love shooting RAW on my iPhone and also greatly enjoy carrying around a "big camera". I'm currently back and forth between using a [Sony a7riv](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/full-frame/p/ilce7rm4-b) and [Leica Q3](https://leica-camera.com/en-US/photography/cameras/q/q3-black).
